Py-Geom is a basic curve and surface generation toy.

This program contains three main utilities:
1) Curve generation from point input. By selecting a curve type from the top bar, the user can generate a curve of that type by clicking to create points. Points can be moved by hovering over them and right clicking, or deleted by hovering and pressing c. All points can be removed at once via the "clear control poitns button".
2) Surface generation. After creating a curve, you can apply primitive operations such as revolution about an axis, extrusion, or performing a sweep of a curve along another curve. You can also apply subdivision surface methods to generated surfaces to obtain smoothed meshes.
3) Curve reconstruction. By adding points in any order while the curve type is set to "Points", you can press the NN-Crust or Crust buttons to attempt to reconstruct a curve. This functionality is buggy.
